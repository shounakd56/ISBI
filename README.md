Whole slide images (WSIs) are high-resolution, gigapixel sized images that pose significant computational challenges for traditional machine learning models due to their size and heterogeneity. In this paper, we present a scalable and efficient methodology for WSI classification by leveraging patch-based feature extraction, clustering, and Fisher vector encoding. Initially, WSIs are divided into fixed-size patches, and deep feature embeddings are extracted from each patch using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). These patch-level embeddings are subsequently clustered using K-means clustering, where each cluster aggregates se mantically similar regions of the WSI. To effectively summa rize each cluster, Fisher vector representations are computed by modeling the distribution of patch embeddings in each cluster as a parametric Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The Fisher vectors from each cluster are concatenated into a high dimensional feature vector, creating a compact and informa tive representation of the entire WSI. This feature vector is then used by a classifier to predict the WSIâ€™s diagnostic label. Our method captures local and global tissue structures and yields robust performance for large-scale WSI classification, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability compared to other approaches.
